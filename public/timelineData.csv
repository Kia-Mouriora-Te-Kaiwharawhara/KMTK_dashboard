1957,Construction on the Lower Karori Dam,Construction of the Karori resivoir bypass overflow,"Excepts from Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Toanga:Since being designated the capital in 1865, Wellington had grown apace. Significant development of the infrastructure was planned and the population was expected to increase rapidly, with immigration schemes already bringing people in. In 1867 the Wellington Town Board started planning a water supply scheme for public use.

The Kaiwharawhara Stream was selected as the source for the water supply, because of its clean water (other streams were being used as sewers) and its elevation (allowing the water to flow by gravity). Work finally got underway in 1872, with the building of a tunnel through Baker's Hill to the head of the Aro Valley and at the other end of the tunnel a distributing basin. Shortage of funds at this point delayed the construction of the dam and so a small weir was placed across the Kaiwharawhara Stream to divert a flow into the tunnel with the distributing basin acting as a reservoir. The houses of Wellington began receiving piped water from this source in May 1874.",historical,https://archivesonline.wcc.govt.nz/assets/display/272020-max?u=8006402cee35c9542c2af77a8b5dd422,https://archivesonline.wcc.govt.nz/nodes/view/675848,-41.29101142,174.7534087

950,Kupe Arrives in Aotearoa,Statue of Kupe on the Wellington waterfront,"According to some tribal narratives, Kupe was the first Polynesian to discover the islands of New Zealand. His journey there was triggered by difficulties with fishing in Hawaiki, his homeland. Apparently the problem was a great octopus belonging to Kupe’s competitor, Muturangi. Kupe set out in his canoe to kill the octopus, and such was the length of the pursuit that it brought him to New Zealand. With a companion known as Ngake (or Ngahue) in another canoe called Tāwhirirangi, he pursued the creature all the way to Cook Strait (known as Raukawakawa), where it was finally destroyed. read more about the story of Kupe: http://archive.hokulea.com/ike/moolelo/kupe.html",purakau,https://www.upperhutt.govt.nz/files/assets/public/v/1/heritage/statue_of_kupe_wellington_waterfront.jpg?w=1080,https://www.upperhutt.govt.nz/Welcome/Mana-Whenua/Kupe,,

3,Māui fishes New Zealand out of the ocean,Māui fishing New Zealand out of the ocean,"Māui is the great trickster hero of Polynesian mythology. Much pre-European Polynesian history is related to this inventive character. Many of the stories are legendary – the theft of fire, the capture of the sun, the pursuit of immortality, the descent into the underworld in search of his father. A central story about Māui tells of how he fished up the North Island of New Zealand. The South Island is referred to as Te Waka-a-Māui, or Māui’s canoe. Rakiura (Stewart Island) is the canoe’s anchor stone and it is said that Māui stood at the peninsula at Kaikōura while he hauled up his prized catch.
